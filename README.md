# 📐 Wireframing

## 📝 Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a fundamental step in the **UI/UX design process**. It involves creating simple, visual guides that represent the skeletal structure of a website or application. These outlines help designers and stakeholders visualize layout, navigation, and content placement before the actual design and development begin.

## 🎯 Why Wireframing is Important

Wireframing plays a crucial role in ensuring the success of digital products by:

- 🧭 **Clarifying Navigation**: It shows how users will move through the interface.
- 📐 **Visualizing Layout**: It maps out the placement of key elements like buttons, text, images, and menus.
- 💬 **Enhancing Communication**: It serves as a communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- 🧪 **Identifying Usability Issues Early**: It helps detect potential problems before investing time in high-fidelity design or coding.
- 💰 **Saving Time and Cost**: Early revisions are faster and cheaper to implement in a wireframe than in code.

Wireframes are typically created using tools like Figma, Balsamiq, or Adobe XD, and come in **low-fidelity** (basic outlines) or **high-fidelity** (detailed mockups) forms.

By starting with wireframes, teams can ensure a shared understanding of the user experience and iterate quickly toward effective, user-centered solutions.
